# Requirements
To run selenium at a fast pace, I reccoment you have at least 4GB of ram and a somewhat decent processor. Selenium, requests, and BS4 is needed to run the program smoothly. Chrome driver is a must and you will be asked where chromedriver is located. Download it here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
